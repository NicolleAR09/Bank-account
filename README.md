### Bank account 
The code allows a person to perform operations on their bank account using object-oriented POO programming. 

First there is a class called "Persona", and "Persona" is going to have only two attributes: first name and last name. Then, a second class called "Cliente", and Cliente will inherit from Persona, because customers are people, so the Cliente will then inherit the attributes of Persona, but will also have own attributes, such as account number and balance, that is, the balance you have in your bank account. 

Cliente also has three methods. The first will allow when the code asks to print Client, all your data will be displayed, including your account balance. Then, a method called Deposit, which will allow you to 
decide how much money you want to add to your account. And finally, a third method called Withdraw, which allows you to decide how much money you want to take out of your account. 


The program asks the user to choose whether to make deposits or withdrawals. The user can do as many operations as he wants until he decides to leave the program. Therefore, the code keeps track of how much money is in the balance, and the customer will never be able to withdraw more money than he owns.
